# Steps

This folder documents the actual steps shown in the WhirlyTask Add Step menu.

Each step has its own page. The groups below match the menu groups in the editor.

If you are not sure what a track, advanced track, or sequence is, start with [Basics](../Basics/README.md).

Most step pages explain:

- What the step does.
- What each field means.
- How to set it up from scratch.
- What it is useful for.
- Common mistakes.
- Related examples or troubleshooting pages.

## Good Testing Pattern

When a step does not work, test it alone first:

```text
1. Status Message Starting test
2. The step you are testing
3. Status Message Finished test
4. Stop Sequence
```

For full patterns like loops, retries, watcher recovery, and notifications, see [Examples](../Examples/README.md).
