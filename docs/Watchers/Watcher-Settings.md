# Watcher Settings

Watcher settings control when a watcher checks, when it can fire again, and what happens if another watcher is already running.

Use this page when a watcher fires too often, does not fire, or overlaps with another watcher in a confusing way.

## Main Settings

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| State | Turns the watcher on or off |
| Trigger type | What kind of condition the watcher checks |
| Trigger mode | How the condition is tested |
| Trigger value | The text, image, window, value, chance, or internet state to check |
| Area | Where screen-based triggers look |
| Scan interval | How often the watcher checks screen or window conditions |
| Cooldown | How long the watcher waits before it can fire again |
| Conflict | What to do if this watcher fires while another watcher is already running |
| After | What the watcher should do after its steps finish |

## Trigger Settings

The trigger type decides which fields matter.

| Trigger type | Common fields |
| --- | --- |
| Text | Text, mode, area, scan interval |
| Image | Image target, mode, area, scan interval |
| Window | Window title, mode, scan interval |
| Sequence Value | Value name, compare mode, compare text |
| Chance | Percent chance, roll interval |
| Internet | Online or offline mode, scan interval |
| Timer | Timer mode, seconds |

For details on each trigger, see [Triggers](Triggers/README.md).

## State

State controls whether the watcher is active.

| State | Result |
| --- | --- |
| On | The watcher can fire while the sequence runs |
| Off | The watcher is saved but ignored during playback |

Turn a watcher off when you want to keep it for later but do not want it affecting the current test.

## Scan Interval

Scan interval controls how often WhirlyTask checks a trigger that needs polling.

Text, Image, Window, Internet, and Chance triggers use this kind of interval. Chance uses it as a roll interval.

Timer triggers do not use scan interval. They use their own seconds field with `after` or `every`.

Short intervals react faster, but they can cost more work and may fire during temporary screen changes.

Long intervals are calmer, but the watcher can feel slower.

## Cooldown

Cooldown controls how long the watcher waits after firing before it can fire again.

Use a longer cooldown when:

- the same warning stays on screen
- Discord or status messages repeat too often
- recovery steps need time to finish
- a connection or window state flickers

## Conflict

Conflict controls what happens when this watcher fires while another watcher is already running.

| Conflict option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ignore | Do not start this watcher while another watcher is running |
| Stop watcher | Let this watcher take over and stop the current watcher path |
| Run alongside | Let this watcher run while the other watcher continues |

## Choosing A Conflict Option

Use `Ignore` for most recovery watchers. It prevents two recovery paths from fighting over the same app.

Use `Stop watcher` when the new watcher is more important than the current one. For example, an emergency stop watcher should interrupt a slower notification watcher.

Use `Run alongside` for small side effects that are safe to overlap, such as status messages or independent Discord alerts.

## After

After controls what happens once watcher steps finish.

If the watcher never uses [Pause Sequence](Steps/Pause-Sequence.md), the main sequence usually keeps going while the watcher runs.

If the watcher uses Pause Sequence, make sure the watcher steps clearly continue, reset, or stop the sequence.

## Good Defaults

| Watcher purpose | State | Cooldown | Conflict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Popup recovery | On | 5 to 15 seconds | Ignore |
| Discord notification | On | 30 seconds or more | Run alongside |
| Emergency stop | On | 1 to 5 seconds | Stop watcher |
| Testing a new watcher | On | 3 to 10 seconds | Ignore |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
| --- | --- |
| Watcher does not fire | Check State, trigger fields, area, scan interval, and cooldown |
| Watcher fires repeatedly | Increase Cooldown |
| Two watchers fight each other | Use `Ignore` or `Stop watcher` instead of `Run alongside` |
| Recovery starts too slowly | Lower Scan interval carefully |
| Main steps keep running during recovery | Add [Pause Sequence](Steps/Pause-Sequence.md) near the start of watcher steps |
